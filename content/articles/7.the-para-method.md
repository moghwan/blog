Organizing your notes is one of the most time consuming things you do more often than you think, from saving your reading lists to your inspirations, and rapidely you find yourself in the obligation of cleaning the clutter which, becames a reccuring task itself. and then Bowser stage: endlessly jumping from a note taking app to another because you find about a new app that does the same thing but “better”.

### context

I was a huge fan of google keep for its simplicity, but ditched it for two reasons, limitations regarding the nature of data i’m saving besides images and check notes (files, data tables), and trying to move out from as explained in my previous post *process to decentralize my data*. colored notes and folders we’re enough after some heavy use.

the journey to migrate to a new note taking app begun after two choices popped out: Obsedian and Notion. I went with the latter because of accessibility and features, compared to the former even if they had a proper app.

and then the PARA method appeared few months later while I was chitchatting with a friend. headlines were it was an app agnostic, meaning you can implement it in your favorite app, and secondly it was a one time setup that’s (iconically) time consuming but has a positive impact afterward, also he demoed me his setup so i liked the way all his stuff, or should i say literally his digital life, was organized from personal notes to side/projects to work related stuff to his legal documents.

## para

Let's get to the heart of the matter. The method was created by called [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/start-here/), it’s an app-agnostic method so you can implement it in *almost* whatever note-taking app you use. you dont have to stick literally with what’s defined, it’s more flexible and extensible than you think, just keep in mind the main idea.

it consists on four key sections:

- Projects
- Areas
- Resource
- Archive

Let me elaborate each point:

- Projects: literally a project, and by definition it definitely has “tasks”. in another word a project is something you want to achieve with a timeline or a process you define, and you dont want it to stick in your butt for a longer period until it became a lifetime burden on your shoulders. thus the most important things it should have are a start & end date, and a goal. the *goal* is part isnt put randomly, a project is without a goal is either a doomed to be either a dream or a hobby. and finally a project always belongs to an area
- Areas: similar to projects in every way but being the opposite in other ways, areas are places for your personal relevant informations, and sticks with you for a longer period, if not for life, for example your career, side projects, health, legal documents and more, you define it. so if an area isnt tied to a start/end date it means it’s meant to be maintained and regularely updated.
- Resources: you can take it as an enhanced “bookmarks”, with the addition of other types of resources than links, such as files and databases, you name it, depends the  app you’re using. the bonus point is it could be linked to any area or project, or both, but remains optional.
- Archive: very useful when cleaning the clutter from the previous discussed sections, e.g. completed projects, an idle area, an outdated resource, in my case.

at somepoint while reading this post, you probably asked yourself “what if i just had something to remember/do but there’s neither a project nor and area could relate to it? where should i put this one?”, short answer: a starting point called “Inbox”

An inbox, to simplify, is a group of tasks that still dont have a linked project/area to it (or becoming a future one), yet. that’s it, that’s the tw.. definition.

so to summerize:

- grouped tasks are usually projects, could be used with areas
- projects have deadlines and goals, areas dont
- a project without a goal is a dream/hobby
- personal revelant informations are kept in areas, general and useful ones in resources
- you dont need to have projects and areas and resources to start using the method

one great thing about the method is it follows your pace depending the things you do, for example areas arent often updated, in opposite of projects (if you had many)

great doesnt mean perfect, i’ve used for a while it to track my movies and series watch list, but since they had their won platform like letterboxd, goodreads & anilist, i kept it only for what should i start next with a selective and mixed list.

### implementation

- notion only
- approach 1: all in one database, with categories of “PARA” sections

// excalidraw 1

- approach 2: each section have it’s own database except for archive, that would be an attribute of type checkbox,

// excalidraw 2

tasks arent a core thing to this methodology, but i found many folks create a separate database for it which is, optionally, linked to a project, an area or a resource, why not!

// exaclidraw 3



for a rapid access to tasks and resources, i’ve made a custom template for projects and areas as below, which shows list of tasks and resources related to the current project/area with the help of filters

and finally, a *dashboard* page that have views from different sections

### conclusion

the goal of this post is to give you a general idea of this method i’ve been using for a couple of years now, and seemed to be better than expected in for a long term use. there are way too much resources on the web but you’ll often find out that the explainer add his *touch* to the implementation of the method in an app, notably notion, to distinguish himself.

- gif of i liked it i did it for myself, to express the like-hate of notion-para
- found out he migrated to evernote and kept the para implementation
