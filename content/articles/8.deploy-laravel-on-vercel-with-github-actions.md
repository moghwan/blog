So you had an(other) idea for your next backend side project and, of course as a PHP developer, you decided to go with your beloved Laravel, but! instead of spending another 6$ on a new droplet on digitalocean, you decided to go serverless free with Vercel; Or at least this was my short story.
In this article, I'll share my experience deploying a Laravel 11 API with Vercel. this journey have many checkpoints as mebtioned below:
- Understanding Serverless
  - why serverless?
    - familiar with vercel, free, wanted to try its php runtime
  - Vercel's php runtimes
    `vercel-php@0.7.1` for PHP 8.3.x
    `vercel-php@0.6.2` for PHP 8.2.x
    `vercel-php@0.5.5` for PHP 8.1.x
    `vercel-php@0.4.4` for PHP 8.0.x
    `vercel-php@0.3.6` for PHP 7.4.x
- Serverless trade-offs
    - readonly sqlite db/filesystem (external db instance, supabase for example)
    - no ssh (_serverless_ for _no server_)
    - no long-running processes for free tier plan (10-second timeout limit, https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#max-duration)
- Bootstrapping Laravel for Vercel (exalidraw)
> tl;dr: the whole process is defined in details in a repo I made while writing this article, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/)
  - vercel's basic config
    - choosing runtime
    - setting up env vars in vercel.json
    - setting up env vars in vercel dashboard
  - problems i faced
    - readonly logs (permissions): 
      - fixed by adding sentry
    - /api conflict ?
      - maybe should have dug more into vercel's docs
    - multi deployment on git push
      - solved by switching deployment from vercel's CICD to github actions
    - in gh actions
- bonus: a basic benchmarking
  - resume the thread
- Case Study: Low-Traffic POCs and backend apis
- conclusion
  So, what to choose?
  - Vercel: Ideal for low-traffic apps/POCs due to cost. Optimize code to avoid timeouts (upgrade for more time).
  - DigitalOcean: More control, better for potentially longer-running operations.
