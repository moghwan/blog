So you had an(other) idea for your next backend side project and, of course as a PHP developer, you decided to go with your beloved Laravel, but! instead of spending another 6$ on a new droplet on digitalocean, you decided to go serverless free with Vercel; Or at least this was my short story.

In this article, I'll share my experience deploying a Laravel 11 API with Vercel. this journey have many checkpoints as mentioned below:
- why going Serverless
- Serverless trade-offs
- Bootstrapping Laravel for Vercel
- encountered hassles

## serverless with php, really?
yes, really. The initial motive was simple, finding a(n alternative) platform when I can deploy a Laravel app fast & furee, and since i'm familiar with vercel It was the first option popped into my mind and also, I've (somehow) remembered that it supports php runtime now, so why not give it a try? 

## Serverless trade-offs
if you're not familiar with the term, serverless is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates resources as needed, great for scalability for spikes traffics. and you dont overhead your grey matter with managing and maintaining the infra.
but this comes with some trade-offs:
  - a readonly filesystem: not great if you want to use a sqlite database for example, this will force you to use an external db service like supabase.
  - no ssh: because there's no server.
  - no long-running processes: vercel's case, a max 10-second timeout for requests, for free tier plan at least. you can always upgrade to pro plan to increase the duration. https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#max-duration)
and honestly, these trade-offs aren't that bad, especially if you're building a small app or a POC or, as in my case, a backend api.

## Bootstrapping a Laravel project
> tl;dr: the whole process is defined in details in a repo-template I've made while tinkering vercel's edge functions, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/). also i tried to make [relevant atomic commits](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/commits/master/) for an easier history navigation. im going just give you a brief overview of the process.
### Vercel's php runtimes
Vercel doesn't support php out of the box, but it does offer a powerful runtime system that allows you to run php applications. The runtime system is based on the vercel-php package, which provides support for different php versions from 7.4 to 8.3.
Here are the available versions:
  - `vercel-php@0.7.1` for PHP 8.3.x
  - `vercel-php@0.6.2` for PHP 8.2.x
  - `vercel-php@0.5.5` for PHP 8.1.x
  - `vercel-php@0.4.4` for PHP 8.0.x
  - `vercel-php@0.3.6` for PHP 7.4.x
to choose a specific version, you can add a `vercel.json` file to your project's root directory with the following content:
```json [vercel.json]
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/index.php": {
      "runtime": "vercel-php@0.6.1" // using php 8.2 here
    }
  }
}
```  
### vercel's basic config
there's a lot of tutorials out there that can help you with the basic setup, but here's a quick overview of the steps:
  - create a `/api/index.php` file in your project's root directory and require `public/index.php` to forward requests to normal `index.php`
  - setting up your env vars in vercel.json
  - setting up env vars in vercel dashboard (APP_KEY and secrets).
  - setting up your vercel secrets in your github secrets (for CI/CD, more on that later).

## encountered hassles
im gonna just speedlisting the problems i faced and how i solved them:
- readonly logs (permissions) fixed by:
  - [adding sentry](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/commit/3be8d803e18920db047af83f05e23b6644906698) (added a sentry dsn to my env vars in vercel dashboard too)
  - in vercel.json, setting the variables:
    - `APP_ENV` to `production`
    - `APP_DEBUG` to `false`
- `/api` endpoint returning 404:
  - changed laravel's default prefix from to `/backend` in [bootstrap/app.php](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/commit/6d41e5579d0a43e7efdef5d461f562feecf20c3d)
- 500 error with vercel's cicd on git push:
  - solved by switching deployment from vercel's CICD to github actions
  - disabled vercel's auto deployment in [vercel.json](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/commit/0f454059be23e494a6b18ead7d5f062a4ed629da)
  - added a [github action](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml) to deploy on push to master branch
speaking of the 500 error, i didnt dig deep into the issue, and the error didnt occur when deployed manually with vercel cli, so i just switched to github actions for the deployment.
it was an occasion too to add extra steps to the deployment process, like running migrations, seeding the database and force deploy without cache.

## conclusion
so what did i learn from this experience? well, vercel is a great platform for deploying small apps or POCs, especially for a cost-effective solution. the trade-offs are manageable, and the ease of use and built-in CI/CD are definite advantages, compared to digitalocean's app platform which provides you with a similar experience but only free for your first 3 static sites projects. however, for more control and potentially longer-running operations, a traditional VPS like a DigitalOcean droplet might be a better fit.
there's other things i didnt try them out yet with vercel:
  - cron jobs and queues
  - livewire and pulse
  - inertiajs

last but not least, i've made a small benchmarking test between vercel and digitalocean, and surprisingly, vercel was a bit faster than digitalocean.
i've shared some results on a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/1c2nqrz/laravel_performance_vercels_serverless_vs_the/) and a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/moghwan/status/1778543140280115620) if you want to check them out.

that's it! i hope this post gave you a good overview of deploying a laravel app on vercel, and if you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on twitter or github.
