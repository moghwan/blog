Laravel on Vercel: A Guide with Benchmarking and Trade-offs

This guide explores deploying a Laravel application on Vercel, a serverless platform. We'll discuss the benefits, limitations, and considerations involved in this approach, along with real-world benchmark results.

I. Understanding Laravel on Vercel

    Serverless Deployment: Briefly explain Vercel and its suitability for serverless deployments of Laravel applications.
    Key Considerations:
        Runtime Compatibility: Discuss the lack of direct PHP version support on Vercel and explore workarounds (e.g., serverless frameworks with Laravel compatibility).
        Serverless Trade-offs: Highlight limitations like read-only file systems (mentioning external databases) and restrictions on long-running processes (refer to Vercel's documentation on timeout limits).

II. Bootstrapping Your Laravel Project on Vercel (Optional)

    This section can be included if you want to provide a step-by-step guide on setting up a Laravel project for Vercel deployment. It can cover:
        Initializing a Laravel project.
        Configuration for Vercel deployment (vercel.json).
        Environment variables handling (Vercel, GitHub Actions, .env files).
        Deployment workflow (automatic deployment on Git push).

III. Benchmarking and Considerations

    Real-World Performance: Share your Reddit post about benchmarking Laravel application performance on Vercel (serverless) vs. DigitalOcean (traditional hosting). Include key findings like Vercel's surprising speed advantage and the 10-second timeout limitation.
    Choosing the Right Platform: Discuss the trade-offs between Vercel and DigitalOcean based on your project's needs (cost, control, scalability).
    Vercel's Benefits: Highlight Vercel's advantages like built-in CI/CD and ease of use, but mention the lack of SSH access (serverless trade-off).

IV. Case Study: Low-Traffic POCs

    Explain how Vercel can be ideal for deploying low-traffic applications and Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) due to its cost-effectiveness. Emphasize the importance of code optimization to avoid timeouts.

V. Conclusion

    Summarize the key takeaways for deploying Laravel applications on Vercel.
    Briefly mention your deploy-ready GitHub repository with benchmark code and instructions (https://github.com/Janiaje/laravel-benchmark).
    Encourage feedback and discussions on the topic.

Additional Notes:

    You can incorporate key points from your Twitter thread to support your explanations.
    Consider including a table summarizing the benchmark results (Vercel, DigitalOcean, Local Machine) for easy comparison.
    Tailor the level of technical detail in section II (Bootstrapping) based on your target audience.

This structure effectively combines your draft outline with the valuable insights from your Reddit post and Twitter thread. It provides a clear understanding of running Laravel on Vercel, along with practical considerations backed by your real-world benchmarking.

So you had an(other) idea for your next backend side project and, of course as a PHP developer, you decided to go with your beloved Laravel, but! instead of spending another 6$ on a new droplet on digitalocean, you decided to go serverless free with Vercel; Or at least this was my short story.
In this article, I'll share my experience deploying a Laravel 11 API with Vercel. this journey have many checkpoints as mebtioned below:
- Understanding Serverless
  - why serverless?
    - familiar with vercel, free, wanted to try its php runtime
  - Vercel's php runtimes
    `vercel-php@0.7.1` for PHP 8.3.x
    `vercel-php@0.6.2` for PHP 8.2.x
    `vercel-php@0.5.5` for PHP 8.1.x
    `vercel-php@0.4.4` for PHP 8.0.x
    `vercel-php@0.3.6` for PHP 7.4.x
- Serverless trade-offs
    - readonly sqlite db/filesystem (external db instance, supabase for example)
    - no ssh (_serverless_ for _no server_)
    - no long-running processes for free tier plan (10-second timeout limit, https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#max-duration)
- Bootstrapping Laravel for Vercel (exalidraw)
> tl;dr: the whole process is defined in details in a repo I made while writing this article, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/moghwan/laracel-app/)
  - vercel's basic config
    - choosing runtime
    - setting up env vars in vercel.json
    - setting up env vars in vercel dashboard
  - problems i faced
    - readonly logs (permissions): 
      - fixed by adding sentry
    - /api conflict ?
      - maybe should have dug more into vercel's docs
    - multi deployment on git push
      - solved by switching deployment from vercel's CICD to github actions
    - in gh actions
- bonus: a basic benchmarking
  - resume the thread
- Case Study: Low-Traffic POCs and backend apis
- conclusion
  So, what to choose?
  - Vercel: Ideal for low-traffic apps/POCs due to cost. Optimize code to avoid timeouts (upgrade for more time).
  - DigitalOcean: More control, better for potentially longer-running operations.
