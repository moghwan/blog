If you have a Google account and an Android device, you're likely relying heavily on their services, right? Chrome seamlessly syncing passwords, bookmarks, and extensions across devices? Convenient! Google Photos with smart search, photo tagging, and location information in Maps, offering a generous 100GB basic plan for just $2/month? Sounds awesome!

But imagine losing access to your Google account. No email, no Drive documents, no saved locations in Maps, and none of your saved website passwords recoverable. Ouch.

While some services are likely to remain due to their popularity and profitability, a data breach could still mean significant losses. Diversifying where you store your data is a wise move, even if it adds another password to your arsenal (enter your trusty password manager!).

Consider ditching the Google overlord altogether. Websites like killedbygoogle.com track services Google has shut down, highlighting the impermanence of their offerings. Remember, decentralization isn't just about data security; it's also about empowering yourself and avoiding vendor lock-in.

Thankfully, we still haven't seen Google Wallet/Pay in Morocco, so that's one less concern for now. However, Google's reach extends far beyond payment services.

Did you know that getting banned by Google on one service applies to all of its services too? This means a seemingly minor misstep on YouTube could lock you out of your entire Google account, including Gmail, Drive, and Photos. Yikes!

Taking control of your data starts with understanding it. Using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) allows you to download a copy of all your data, giving you a safety net and the freedom to explore alternative services.

Decentralizing your calendar and planning can be tricky. While Google Calendar's seamless integration with Android is undeniably convenient, exploring alternatives is worthwhile. I've been experimenting with Notion's calendar, and although it doesn't show Google Tasks yet (a major drawback for me), it aggregates events from various sources, including your Google account and Notion pages. If Google Tasks integration ever arrives, I'd readily switch on desktop and eagerly await the mobile app.

Ironically, Google Authenticator is currently the most reliable 2FA option offered by Google itself. However, relying on a single service for such a critical security measure isn't ideal. Consider using a third-party app like Authy or Microsoft Authenticator, and remember to disable the sync feature in Google Authenticator's app settings.

Here's a breakdown of where I could decentralize my data:
- Passwords: Been using LastPass for long time, and switched to Bitwarden due to many data breaches discovered in the former. Still not tried Google's KeyPass and, won't.
- Browsing: Currently and happily on firefox, and if in any case I'm switching to another it would be a problem at all, to the contrary of chrome if using it's built in password manager. bookmarks in the other hand are easy to import/export due to the not-so-sensitive data.
- Google Poscasts: in favor of spotify since the former is the next on the killedbygoogle list, shutted down in [April 2024](https://www.theverge.com/23891397/google-podcasts-youtube-spotify-alternatives-pocket-casts). And god it was such a good (web)app.

What's Remaining:
- Google tasks to TickTick
- Google Calendar to Notion Calendar
- Google Photos to Nextcloud
- Gmail to (still thinking about it)
- Google Drive (still thinking about it - bis)
- Google Maps (for saving locations)

Remember, decentralization is a journey, not a destination. Start small, experiment with different tools, and gradually move your data away from Google's clutches.
